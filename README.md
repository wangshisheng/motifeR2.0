motifeR 2.0: improving analysis and annotation of protein post-translational modification motifs

## Brief Description
**<font size='5'> motifeR 2.0</font>** is a web-based tool, which possesses the core functions as previously implemented in the first version (motifeR published in 2019) with an addition of several new features, including:
    1. Mapping the PTM site and protein sequences and identifiers between non-human species and H. sapiens;
    2. Calculating sequence window similarity and allowing thresholds of similarity filtering for motif mapping;
    3. Offering more flexible annotation based on kinase-substrate databases (e.g. PhosphoSitePlus) and network plots;
    4. Visualizing the expression of modification sites on interacting proteins on the basis of public or user-uploaded protein-protein interaction data.
